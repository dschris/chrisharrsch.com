    "intro": [
        "I am an engineer and physicist turned blockchain architect. I approach capital markets with a systems-view mindset: to build effective technology, you must first master the environment it operates in.",
        "Currently, I lead digital asset product development at Nasdaq. Driven by a desire to understand the 'full stack' of our financial reality, my focus extends beyond the technology itself to the market structures it serves. By deconstructing the complex machinery of global finance, I apply my deep understanding of blockchain protocols to the areas where they offer genuine institutional value."
